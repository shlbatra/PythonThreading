- process vs threads
- process see in task manager. program running on computer. 
- each process made up of diff threads. thread is a task assosciated with process
- In ram, allocate space for process. 
- In single core, read and write instructions to ram. In 4 core, we can split 
tasks and processes into 4 groups. 
- on a specific core, we have sequence of threads. 
- each process made up of threads - diff tasks running, Only 1 thread run at one time for a specific core, 
- Python program - single threaded process for now. Create and switch threads for diff functions in Python program.
