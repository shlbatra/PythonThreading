# Asynchronous operations

- Ex. retreiving data from db, web scraping, interacting with api
- traditionally async and parallel methods use threads
- app run -> launch process -> process is CPU and RAM allocate -> Within process, have 1 or more threads -> 
- process seperate memory and thread share memory, wait for opns ex. I/O -> thread do other things 
- Threads Issue
    - share memory so get bugs where threads try to read/write same time leading to unpredictable behavior
    - program harder to understand as diff threads interact with each other
-  introduce overhead as part of system needs to manage threads
- Alt to Threads - asynchronous programming
    - relies on future / promise / delay / deferred
    - describe sort of proxy for our object -> unknown and resolved in future
    - becuase computation not yet completed
    - syntax extension to help write code that uses them and not create yourself
    - futures -> come from functional programming
- library -> asyncio 
    - async -> define methods as async to run them asynchroniously
    - await -> wait for sync method to finish
- Adding parallelism 
    - waiting for devices to connect, no need to wait as independent devices
    - gather -> allows to run things in parallel
    - combine sequential and parallel opns 
- handle streams, sub processes, queues, etc
